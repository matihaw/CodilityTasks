All tasks from Codility that I have done

# Arrays

* ###[CyclicRotation](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/cyclic_rotation/) - 100%
Rotate an array **A** to the right by a given number **k** of steps.


* ### [OddOccurrencesInArray](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/odd_occurrences_in_array/) - 66%()
Find value that occurs in odd number of elements in array **A**.

# Time Complexity

* ### [FrogJmp](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/frog_jmp/) - 100%
Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y. D is a lenght of jump.

* ### [PermMissingElem](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/perm_missing_elem/) - 100%
Find the missing element in a given permutation.

# TapeEquilibrium

* ### [TapeEquilibrium](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/tape_equilibrium/) - 100%
Minimize the value ``` |(A[0] + ... + A[P-1]) - (A[P] + ... + A[N-1])| ```.

# Counting Elements

* ### [FrogRiverOne](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/4-counting_elements/frog_river_one/) - 100%
Find the earliest time when a frog can jump to the other side of a river (from position 0 to position X+1).

* ### [MaxCounters](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/4-counting_elements/max_counters/) - 100%
Calculate the values of counters after applying all alternating operations: increase counter by 1; set value of all counters to current maximum.
